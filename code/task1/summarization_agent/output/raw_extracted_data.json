Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering\nCairo University\nCumulative Grade: Very Good (80%)\nFourth Year Grade: Excellent (89%) \nProfessional Experience\n2025/07 – 2025/09\nAI Full-Time Internship\nTechnoWelle GmbH\nContributed to the development of an Agentic AI system for automating the Hardware-in-\nthe-Loop (HIL) testing process in automotive embedded systems. The system consisted of \n7 agents that streamlined the entire workflow: from generating comprehensive test plans, \nto producing code-agnostic test cases across multiple HIL languages, to executing these \ntests on real hardware with automated issue reporting. It supported two major HIL \ntestbenches: Vector Informatik VT System and Technowelle’s proprietary HIL. This project \nstrengthened my expertise in AI agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG), modern agent protocols (MCP, A2A), LLM fine-tuning, \nand advanced prompt engineering strategies.\n2024/10 – 2025/06\nGraduation Project\nSponsored by Si-Vision\nDesigned and evaluated deep learning systems under adversarial attack scenarios to study \nmodel vulnerabilities and robustness in both computer vision (CV) and natural language \nprocessing (NLP), including large language models (LLMs).\nKey Contributions:\n•Model Development:\nBuilt and fine-tuned models like Image Classification EfficientNet Model (CV) and \nSentiment Analysis / LLMs (NLP).\n•Adversarial Attacks:\nCV Attacks: FGSM, PGD, MI-FGSM, SIMBA, ElasticNet, JSMA\nNLP Attacks: UAP, HotFlip, DeepWordBug\nLLM Attacks: Jailbreak Attacks, Prompt Injection\n•Defensive Techniques:\nCV Defenses: Adversarial Training, Noise Fusion, Gradient Masking\nLLM Defenses: Input/Output Filtering, Rewindable Autoregressive Inference (RAIN)\n,Most Highlighted Contribution in LLMs : Implementing an Input Filtering Defense  \nfrom scratch by fine-tuning DistilBert LLM using LoRA technique to distinguish between \njailbreak & safe prompts achieving a reduction in Attack success rate from 87% to 0%\n2024/07 – 2024/09\nSW Engineering intern\nLXT AI\nFull Stack Developer – Worked on backend and frontend teams.\nFinal Project: Full-stack To-Do List app with React (frontend), FastAPI (Python \nbackend), and PostgreSQL (database).\nProjects\n• Agentic Arabic Prompt Engineer\n  Built an autonomous agent with LangChain that refines Arabic prompts via multi-step reasoning, self-evaluation, \nand feedback optimization.\n•  Arabic Q/A RAG System\n   Building a RAG system using an Arabic book as the knowledge base. The book was split into short paragraphs, \nembedded with a multilingual model, and indexed with FAISS. For each Arabic query, relevant text is retrieved and \npassed to an LLM to generate an answer. We also compared this with LLM-only answers.\n• Implementation of EfficientNet Model\n    Implementing EfficientNet from scratch that is used for Image Classification using Pytorch Framework and \ntraining it over various Datasets like: FashionMnist and Cifar10 and then applying on it Adversarial attacks to test \nModel robustness like FGSM,PGD,Simba and ElasticNet\n• Implementation a Sentiment Analysis NLP model\n     Implementing Sentiment Analysis NLP Model from Scratch and training it on datasets like IMDB reviews and \nYelpReviews and then attacking the models with textual based NLP specified attacks like Character &word-level \nattacks like Deepwordbug,UAP and DeepFool to test model robustness to attacks and applying the concept of \nAdversarial attacks.\n• DoorLocker Security System\n   Developing a system to unlock a door using a password.
